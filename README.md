# Udacity's Reader Testing Project

## <u>Description</u>

The purpose of this project was to use Jasmine Testing Framework to implement tests for a Feed Reader. Among the tests were:

* **Variable Loading** - Ensuring variables load correctly
* **Event Functionality** - Testing click events and class toggles properly working
* **Asynchronous Events** - Creating asynchronous tests to perform after feeds loaded

The tools used were **Jasmine, jQuery,** and **Jasmine jQuery,** along with the provided files and templates. **Gulp** was used for browserSync live updates while working on the project, along with jshint linting.

## <u>How to Run</u>

Due to the various HTTP cdn calls in the original code, the page will not load on Github Preview. In order to open the page properly, you will need to:

* Create a folder
* Navigate to that folder in Terminal or Windows console
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/learnathoner/Reader_Testing.git`
* Open `index.html` from the root directory in your browser

To modify any of the tests, use the `feedreader.js` file found in the `jasmine > spec` folder.
